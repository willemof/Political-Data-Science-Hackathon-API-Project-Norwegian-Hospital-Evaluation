Riksrevisjonen / The Office of the Auditor General of Norway

Save. Pull. Commit. Push. 

## Problem Statement
Previous investigations by the Office of the Auditor General show that there are large differences in efficiency between different regions and hospitals in the specialist health service. 
We therefore want an updated analysis of whether Norwegian hospitals can be run more efficiently, and what differences there are in quality and productivity between different hospitals.

As an initial starting point, we (The Office of the Auditor General) want a descriptive analysis of what each region and each hospital "produces" based on the input factors it has available. Relevant indicators in this context are fixe assets and man-years as measures of available resources, and day treatments, consultations and 24- hour stays as measures of production. Another standardized measure of activity in the health care system is the number of DRG points. A diagnosis related group (DRG) is a grouping of patients who are expected to have similar needs, based in part on the patient's diagnosis, treatment, gender and age.


## Assignment

This is an exploratory task. There are some indications in the problem of what may be relevant goals
for efficiency, productivity and quality in the health care system, but you must limit the analysis to
which indicators and factors you think are most relevant.
It is a clear goal that the work should be reproducible. It is therefore important that data collection,
data manipulation, code and analyzes are documented. Code used should be version controlled.
As a result of the work, it is nice to have a short report, preferably produced in Rmarkdown, where
the process from acquisition to analysis is documented, and significant findings from the analysis are
included.
The task can be solved with the data sets that are available openly online.

1. Obtain relevant data from Statistics Norway and the Norwegian Directorate of Health,
preferably using the API.

2. Carry out a descriptive analysis of key input factors, activity level and indicators for quality at the health region / hospital level.

3. Visualize differences at the health region / hospital level, preferably with interactive figures in a report.

4. Analyze / visualize the productivity of each hospital. Has productivity changed over time? How to compare productivity across hospitals?

5. What is the difference between a regression analysis and a data envelopment analysis with regard to measure productivity? How could a data envelopment analysis have been conducted for this issue?
